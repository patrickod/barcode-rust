# barcode-rust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/patrickod/barcode-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/patrickod/barcode-rust)

Tiny binary to read scancodes from a Inateck BCST-20 barcode scanner which I intend to use to catalogue the book collection at [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net)

This project is mostly an experiment with rust and c libraries
